Inspired by seeing something similar in some other blogs and newsletters I thought I'd add a live list of the stuff I'm learning about currently: eg: clever websites, tools and books!

It's updated as I go. 

Currently
--

- [ ] [Residuality Theory](https://youtu.be/_MPUoiG6w_U) : 
  - how to architect; why is architecture so ad hoc?
  - Complexity theory
  - [ ] [the book: Residues: Time, Change, and Uncertainty in Software Architecture](https://leanpub.com/residuality)
- [ ] [Speed Up Your Python with Rust](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/speed-up-your/9781801811446/) : 
  - Really enjoying the brisk pace
  - Love the step-by-step hands-on grounding in making pip packages and how installing works
  - Need a diagram to track the entry points and exits of the Rust code to Python; all a bit confused rn!
  - Have to learn Rust properly however
  - [ ] [deploy onto raspberry pi](https://docs.wasmer.io): The project I have in mind (music stuff!) will run on a Pi; this gets it there. I hope!
- [ ] Making Sounds
  - There's a whole world of music processing tech! One of those niche's that progress along on their own slightly obscured from outsiders: with their own leaders, vocab, 
    common knowledge... Unless 
    you 
    dive in and make sense of it all!
  - [ ] [Pure data](https://puredata.info) : impressive and Fun. but so quirky!
  - [ ] [Pure data book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-sound-with/9781941222492/) : Step-by-step; bit slow, but it's thorough
  - [x] The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music Book pdf - Miller Puckette: PD creator; starts simple, dives deep. Abandoned for now. 
  - [ ] [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) : PD alternative
  - Rust. Low latency / triggers / Midi even? Not sure, but it's building blocks
  - [ ] [Rust Audio](https://rust-audio.github.io) : 
    - [ ] [Rust Audio book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/rust-audio/9781801072444/) : Not started
  
- [ ] Simpy : Python simulation framework; fun. Want to make a game, with the engine built around a sim.py simulation. Need a topic!
- Kafka Streams
  - [ ] [Kafka Streams in Action](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kafka-streams-in/9781617294471/) : 
    - Not started
  - [ ] [Mastering Kafka Streams](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-kafka-streams/9781492062486/ch02.html#idm46281564624232)
    - started; nice introduction, good pace; lots in it
    - Going to want to dive into the famous 'data intensive applications' book by Klepperman again. New edition coming!
  

Gawd, there's a lot on my mind.
