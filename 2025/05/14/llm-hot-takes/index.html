                <p>To us developers, LLMs are that quintessential &#8216;threat and opportunity&#8217; that we&#8217;ve all heard about. Sometimes I wonder if 
two commentators are sharing the same baseline experience. Some bloggers say &#8216;vibe coding is the goat&#8217;; others say: &#8216;bah, it barely works&#8217;. What&#8217;s going&nbsp;on?</p>
<p>Needless to say the truth is probably somewhere in between and nuanced. Hopefully this is some&nbsp;nuance.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve found <em>&#8216;<span class="caps">LLM</span> as super-autocomplete&#8217;</em> really useful for learning new frameworks and languages. With a bit of foundational knowledge I can just make vague gestures towards
the direction I want and the &#8216;<span class="caps">LLM</span> as super-autocomplete&#8217; kicks in. Does it help me learn, be productive and get results? Not sure. Feels like a win, but maintainability and best practices are 
  still my responsibility and (as a beginner to that new language) still an unknown - as a novice with the&nbsp;skill.</li>
<li>Skill atrophy: so <span class="caps">LLM</span> feel like a huge skills buff - but what about skill atrophy? I think it&#8217;s too early to tell but I can imagine development reflexes and muscle-memory 
  dissapating. 
  It could mean that we defer most coding tasks to the <span class="caps">LLM</span> and work on a higher level - leaving us to do all architecture and design, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> almost no&nbsp;implementation.</li>
<li>I worry about what this means to the industry in general: Junior devs won&#8217;t need to learn fundamentals. &#8216;You get what you reward&#8217; and if we reward relying on LLMs then juniors will preferentially defer to LLMs and not on their own&nbsp;knowledge.</li>
<li>Junior&#8217;s won&#8217;t be reading code so frequently either: a vital learning stage; just vibe coding new&nbsp;slop.  </li>
<li>I do think it&#8217;s likely to hollow out the mid-tier of the developer workforce. Given the rate of change in the industry there&#8217;s a surprising number of devs that are not very adaptable to change: 
  &#8220;Just give me a Jira ticket; crank out code; rinse, repeat&#8221;. Not comfortable with ambiguity. &#8216;My end of the boat isn&#8217;t sinking&#8217; mentality. This approach is very vulnerable to being replaced by an <span class="caps">LLM</span>,&nbsp;sadly.</li>
<li>How are <span class="caps">LLM</span> on the &#8216;day-to-day&#8217;? It&#8217;s quite a peculiar change in a &#8216;think-do-check&#8217; work cycle and takes some getting used to. There&#8217;s definitely a process of acclimatization and change of&nbsp;habits. </li>
<li>I find the interruptions mean getting into a &#8216;flow state&#8217; of work has changed; bit harder. Still pondering this one&nbsp;tbh.</li>
<li>And 
  what&#8217;s a good metaphor for 
  working with 
  them? Something&nbsp;like:</li>
<li><strong><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>An excitable indefatigable junior&#8217;</strong>: They have lots of energy and have crammed a lot of knowledge but don&#8217;t know how to apply it. We&#8217;re pair programming partners but I have to keep it as 
    unequal 
  as&nbsp;possible.</li>
<li><strong><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>A Genie&#8217;</strong>: You give them commands and magically they do what you ask. With unintended consequences (that are often extremely unfortunate), so keep them on a short&nbsp;leash!</li>
<li><strong><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>As excitable intern&#8217;</strong>: Different to being a &#8216;junior&#8217; as they just don&#8217;t care about any consequences. They fulfil the task and they&#8217;re on to the next&nbsp;thing.</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>&#8216;sycophantic fabulist&#8217;</strong>: they&#8217;ll flatter you and tell you pleasant lies. And cheat if they have to. Tests don&#8217;t pass? No problem, they&#8217;ll just delete&nbsp;them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change in habits will apply to non-developer roles and behaviours too: obviously senior execs seem to be very excited at the opportunity to down-size and de-skill the workforce. Offshore and 
  using 
  LLMs? - irresistable. By the time the terrible quality impacts delivery and maintainability they&#8217;re likely to be long gone with their golden parachutes. Nice work if you can get&nbsp;it.</p>
</li>
<li>But it is true: Product Managers, Engineering Managers and entrepreneurs: can all be programmers now - they all can escape the tyranny of syntax. For society, this might be a good thing. 
  However security, privacy, <span class="caps">AI</span>-slop and an-even-more-dead-internet - these might all get much&nbsp;worse.</li>
<li>Obviously, being a professional has always been more than just knowing syntax or a framework. Decades ago, Djikstra discussed programming being all about mental models and abstractions. Writing 
  the 
  code and mastering syntax is even less essential than ever. Plausible to think a product manager could have a good go at a prototype,&nbsp;say.</li>
<li>One topic that&#8217;s interesting is the application to <strong><span class="caps">QA</span> and tests</strong>: it&#8217;s tempting to just get LLMs to write tests and move on but this misses the point of acceptance testing and the importance of 
  <span class="caps">QA</span> (&amp; <span class="caps">TDD</span> obviously) as tools of design and clarity rather than as an &#8216;after the fact&#8217; pro forma step. Good tests come out of a sophisticated and accurate model of the system and the problem 
  domain: that&#8217;s how you know where the edges of the edge cases&nbsp;are.</li>
<li>This highlights one huge failing of LLMs for code: they can&#8217;t form that overall mental model of a system. This type of understanding is most important in maintanance 
  legacy and novel code-bases and problems. I think this limitation is easily overlooked when dazzled by shiny &#8216;hello world&#8217; demos: greenfield development is so refreshing and&nbsp;rapid.</li>
<li>So given their tendancy to rush, fabulate and lie; How will the trade-off between &#8216;quick&#8217; and &#8216;done properly&#8217; play out? In a couple of years, will we look back at tons of <span class="caps">LLM</span> productivity and 
  shudder? A rat&#8217;s nest of vibe-coded slapdash work? Will there be a backlash; new techniques and methodologies to leverage the tech or just an ugly accomodation and we&#8217;ll just cope? Interesting to&nbsp;speculate.</li>
<li>Elegance - and intuition: these are somewhat aesthetic judgements but it&#8217;s a measure of a good design: simplicity, clarity, maintainability; an elegant solution addresses all of these criteria. 
  LLMs aren&#8217;t tuned to this&nbsp;sentiment.</li>
<li>Maybe we&#8217;ll see <span class="caps">LLM</span> thrive in prototyping. Maybe developers will take over after that initial market- and product- testing phase is successful? Maybe this will mean projects that employ 
  professional developers will be more 
  focussed and more about increase the value of the product rather than just &#8216;get it out the door&#8217;. Maybe developers will collaborate with stakeholders to rapidly use LLMs to get to that product 
  market fit stage&nbsp;rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok that&#8217;s enough for now. Likely to add to this and come back to it as this exciting topic develops. Comments and feedback&nbsp;welcome.</p>
