&lt;p&gt;I hold a weekly mentoring session and this week the topic of &amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; came up. I&amp;#8217;ve had experience with them of course but this gave me the opportunity to dive into them a bit more deeply; this is 
why I like mentoring: it&amp;#8217;s a two-way&amp;nbsp;street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are&amp;nbsp;ADRs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want to learn something new my first stop is &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com"&gt;O&amp;#8217;Reilly&lt;/a&gt;. I like to 
go back to the original sources or at least a measured and thoughtful introduction to the&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s my references: &lt;a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/facilitating-software-architecture/9781098151850/ch06.html#ch06_introducing_architecture_decision_records_1728364283183110"&gt;Facilitating software architecture&lt;/a&gt; has a good chapter on ADRs.
  In this case the &lt;a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~chung/SA/zz-Impreso-architecture_decisions-tyree-05.pdf"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; is brief and&amp;nbsp;sensible: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Previous Developers]&amp;#8230; mostly had good intentions and did what
seemed right in the moment. The decisions
made sense under the circumstances, which
cost and schedule&amp;nbsp;constrained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, looking back, after the dust has settled and the original system designers are long gone, we have
no context around these decisions; we have no
history. All we can do is shake our heads in disbelief. In the end, as Gustave Flaubert reportedly wrote in 1871, “Our ignorance of history
causes us to slander our own&amp;nbsp;times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to see a pithy literary quote in a technical&amp;nbsp;article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual when looking back at source materials, there&amp;#8217;s insights that are not obvious. In this case: 
* &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADR&lt;/span&gt; are immutable
* ADRs conclusions need to be shared
* They should be short - a couple of pages&amp;nbsp;max&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the team reaches a final architectural
decision, they’ll need to “socialize” the result — that is, convince the rest of the organization that they’ve chosen appropriately. 
* todo: More to&amp;nbsp;follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What deserves an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADR&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s tempting to make everything worthy of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADR&lt;/span&gt; - then (apparently) it&amp;#8217;s called an &amp;#8216;All Decision Record&amp;#8217; - which is &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; useful but probably onerous and for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CYA&lt;/span&gt; rather than sharing &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However: there is a standard answer to architectural questions : &amp;#8216;It depends&amp;#8217;. Using this it gives a suggestion on when an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADR&lt;/span&gt; should be created: eg: whenever there&amp;#8217;s a choice. If there&amp;#8217;s no 
trade-offs 
it&amp;#8217;s 
not an 
architectural decision; thus no documentation. If it&amp;#8217;s a decision that posterity might want insight on, then make it an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADR&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Process"></category><category term="Learning"></category><category term="development"></category><category term="process"></category></entry></feed>
