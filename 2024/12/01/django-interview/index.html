                <h2>Django Interview&nbsp;Question</h2>
<p>There was recently a question on Reddit that (to paraphrase) asked: &#8216;I need to interview for a Django developer but I don&#8217;t know anything about Django. What should I&nbsp;ask?&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve hired a few Django (&amp; other) devs and the majority of the hires worked out great so I thought I&#8217;d share some thoughts on an&nbsp;approach.</p>
<h3>Have an explicit goal to each round of&nbsp;interview</h3>
<p>The first things to do is to make the interview purposeful: Let&#8217;s assume the attitude and personality testing stuff is covered elsewhere. Let&#8217;s assume we have verified that their resume is 
more-or-less accurate – these being steps covered in other stages. This should be obvious of course. Similarly, having an idea of what a &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;ideal&#8217; answer to each round is valuable too. For 
a live-coding test, it&#8217;s worth keeping in mind how little can be completed especially under observation and while explaining thought processes; this should be factored into the idea of the ideal&nbsp;answer.</p>
<h3>Django Interview&nbsp;Purpose</h3>
<p>So this round should be to tell if what the candidate says they can do is actually true; and is that at a skill at a level&nbsp;required?</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be an obvious to ask about concepts or define terms - but this can be a bit easy to game: I&#8217;ve thought some candidates were &#8216;talk the talk, but not walk the walk&#8217; types. All it takes is a good 
memory;
or 
luck. So I&#8217;d 
avoid this line of 
enquiry. Besides it takes too long for an interview; it&#8217;s very stressful and just doesn&#8217;t provide much &#8216;signal&#8217;,&nbsp;imho.</p>
<p>Instead, I focus in on practical exercise: what is their approach to making a data model? This is a nice way to see if they actually have the experience they claim; they can think through a problem; 
and 
see if 
they can 
communicate 
clearly. <span class="caps">BTW</span> I thinks it&#8217;s important to share the rubric up-front: eg: this isn&#8217;t about getting the &#8216;right&#8217; answer; it&#8217;s about the process. That it&#8217;s be a conversation about design and developer 
approach; it&#8217;s not a test and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>This approach (and type of question) happily 
works 
for a variety of skill 
levels: A junior developer might convey the basic idea (and show themselves to have an open to learning attitude); while a more senior developer should identify the traps and the&nbsp;pitfalls!</p>
<h3>Model a nested to-do&nbsp;list?</h3>
<p>It can be any simple data modelling question but I like: &#8216;Design a data model for a nested to-do list&#8217;. There&#8217;s plenty of other similar scenarios: &#8216;a forum with nested comments&#8217;; &#8216;a friends&nbsp;list&#8217;;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll go with the &#8216;nested to-do list&#8217; for this example - and it&#8217;s a good balance of &#8216;simple enough to discuss in a sitting&#8217; and &#8216;trickier than it seems!&#8217; to get some juice out of the&nbsp;interview!</p>
<p>A candidate should ask (or be prompted, if they&#8217;re junior) questions around: how many levels of nesting there will be?; are there any restrictions on number of items at each level?; how 
many users?, 
how 
many 
to-do lists per user? and so on&#8230; This can lead to a somewhat typical open-ended discussion on trade-offs and efficiency and some insight on system design priorities. This question is pretty good 
for all languages and frameworks; but I think Django&#8217;s <span class="caps">ORM</span> makes it particularly approachable. It&#8217;s useful for front-end developers too: Modelling a data structure properly in the <span class="caps">FE</span> is just as 
necessary as in&nbsp;backend. </p>
<h3>Why is it&nbsp;tricky?</h3>
<p>Well, the nested business means the data model can&#8217;t be a simple structure: it&#8217;s going to have a self-referential component. Of course, this is Django so we&#8217;ll use the <span class="caps">ORM</span>: so do we have&nbsp;a <code>list</code> 
with many children foreign-key&nbsp;related <code>to-do items</code>? This would be a good start, but we have to consider the nesting. It all starts to get a bit&nbsp;tangled.</p>
<p>Better - and simpler - is to&nbsp;give <code>to-do items</code> a foreign key to themselves. This&nbsp;means <code>to-do item</code>s have as a parent&nbsp;another <code>to-do item</code>. A to-do list is just&nbsp;a <code>to-do item</code> with a null 
parent. We can track &#8216;depth&#8217; of the item by counting the number of parents; it may be convenient to store this in the model&nbsp;too.</p>
<h3>And how would you make a <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> for this data&nbsp;model?</h3>
<p>The question can lead to implementation thoughts on what a <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> for this data model would look like. Again, this should lead to an open-ended discussion. If they bring up <span class="caps">HTMX</span> or GraphQL, 
that&#8217;s an interesting (and permitted) solution too of&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>Experienced developers will have the experience to discuss security; <span class="caps">HTTP</span> methods; statefulness; versioning the <span class="caps">API</span> future-proofing; and more. Do they consider getting the whole data for a nested 
to-do in one go - or just the top level?; how would they handle pagination; authentication; permissions; versioning. So lots of quite interesting topics to&nbsp;discuss.</p>
<p>A more junior developer might be stumped by many of 
these 
concerns; 
but they should be able to immediately grasp the reason why these things are important as soon as they&#8217;re&nbsp;raised.</p>
<h3>Maintainable&nbsp;code</h3>
<p>If there&#8217;s time (and there can be if the interview&#8217;s long enough), it&#8217;s possible to actually get the candidate to build some of this in Django; it can allow insights into maintainability and 
bring up a 
discussion on test-driven development; <span class="caps">SOLID</span> principles and so&nbsp;on. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Obviously a coding interview is stressful to the candidate but at least it&#8217;s more of a &#8216;guided conversation&#8217; rather than a grilling - which I think is a lot less&nbsp;intimidating.</p>
<p>If the candidate&#8217;s made 
these kind of things before (and they 
should have if they&#8217;re a genuine Django candidate) then it should really be a breeze to come up with something workable. They might be time-pressured (stress and being interviewed makes candidates 
forget things) but that&#8217;s okay; the 
goal 
isn&#8217;t to finish the project. They might not get the finer details; but this gives some context to judge one candidate against another: My experience is that candidates diverge quite a lot in their 
ability to tackle the problem; and that&#8217;s allows it to be a discerning&nbsp;factor.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So that&#8217;s one set of interesting questions to ask in a Django interview. It would be a single aspect of a more rounded process of course; but I do think it&#8217;s necessary to have some &#8216;hands-on&#8217; 
coding-based enquiry for a developer job - that isn&#8217;t just on a &#8216;whiteboard&#8217;; or trivia / &#8216;gotcha&#8217; questions; but is actually something of a practical exercise that&#8217;s at least relevant to the job 
of a Django developer. Needless to say, there&#8217;s more to the job than just this; but in an hour - or two - we&#8217;ve got to gain some indications; and we have to start&nbsp;somewhere.</p>
